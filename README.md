# Object-oriented-programming 

Those are 2 project that i created during object oriented programming course <br> <br>
My thoughts about that code after finishing those projects: <br>
-should have done way more classes to make that code more readable and easier to change. <br>
-definitely should have used regex in bibtex project. Is is written as it was a C project. <br>
-in bibtex project the code is really hard to test. That also should be changed.
